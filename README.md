# AnywhereButThere - Airline Management System ✈️

Welcome to *AnywhereButThere*, a fictional airline management system designed to simulate real-world airport lookups, flight path management, and route optimisation.

## Project Overview
This system allows users to:
- Log in as Admin or Customer
- Insert and manage airports and flight paths
- Search and sort travel routes based on distance or layovers
- Perform performance testing on data structures (hash tables, graphs, heaps)

## Key Technical Highlights
- All core data structures (hash tables, graphs, heaps, linked lists, stacks, queues) implemented from scratch (no libraries)
- Graph search algorithms and route optimisation built manually
- Performance testing and visualisation of different sorting algorithms

## Features

### Login Menu
- Admin Login
- Customer Login
- Auto-insert small or large test datasets (airports and flights)
- Performance Testing
- Exit System

### Admin Menu
- Insert airports and flight paths automatically or manually
- Display airports and adjacency list of flight paths
- Search and delete airports or flight paths
- Demonstrates hash table collision handling and resizing

### Customer Menu
- Search for available travel routes
- Sort results by minimum layovers or distance
- View available destination airports

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Numpy
- Math
- Data Structures: Hash Tables, Graphs (Adjacency Lists), Heaps, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues

## How to Run
1. Ensure all required files are in your working directory:
    - `DriverCode-AnywhereButThereTravel.py`
    - Supporting classes: `GraphClass.py`, `HashClass.py`, `HeapClass.py`, etc.
    - CSV files: `SIMPLEAirportTestData.csv`, `AirportDataTest.csv`, etc.
2. Open and run `DriverCode-AnywhereButThereTravel.py`.
3. Follow the menus to insert data, search routes, or perform admin tasks.

## Additional Features
- Performance testing scripts for Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort
- Bash script (`input.sh`) for automated sorting tests
- Graphical output of algorithm performance comparisons

## Credits
- Flight data from [World Airport Codes](https://www.world-airport-codes.com/world-top-30-airports.html) and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_international_airports_by_country)
- Sorting algorithm references from GeeksforGeeks, Visualgo, and other online tutorials.
